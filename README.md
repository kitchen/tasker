What is tasker?

Tasker is a little proof of concept app I want to make to help me keep track of things I want to do on a weekly or monthly basis. The main difference from all the other "just set up a monthly task in $task_manager" things, is that the due date of the next occurence isn't fixed based on some sort of schedule, but based on the last time the task was completed. Or the due dates/times are fairly flexible, so getting reminded on saturday at noon that I need to clean the toilet may not be the best thing, because I may not be ready right that moment to do it, but if I don't get reminded I may not do it, so it should nag me a bit, maybe? Something. Or for tasks I want to do at, ideally, 30 day intervals, like deep cleaning the bath tub or whatever, but I may drift on the due date for a week or 2 (maybe because of weekend plans, or whatever) so instead of having, say, 6 weeks between one, and then getting reminded to clean the tub 2 weeks later, the due date just gets pushed forward from *then*.

This also means I can set up a big pile of these tasks and tackle ones that are ready, and not worry about the ones that were done recently, or maybe push one off to the next week and not have to juggle an entire set of due dates or whatever. This also avoids having to try to manually balance due dates to avoid task stampedes, especially in the face of variable schedules like out of town trips which may obviate the need for doing that task for another week, or maybe make it impossible to do that task for another week.

Some example things I'd like to track with this are:

* clean the toilet (weekly task, should be done saturday/sunday, whenever)
* deep clean the bath tub (monthly task, probably saturday/sunday, but whenever)
* check the smoke detectors (monthly task, can be done any time, but must be at home)
* vacuum the floors (weekly task, saturday or sunday)

The weekly tasks are kinda obvious, and you might say "well, just set aside a time on the weekend to do those things", and you wouldn't be wrong. The hard part is building that habit of checking my "weekly task manager". Currently, I use (Productive.app)[http://productiveapp.io/] to keep track of daily tasks, and while I *could* use them for weekly tasks, the lack of flexibility to do the task on either saturday or sunday is a bit of a bummer, and then there is the the lack of monthly tasks.

Omnifocus could be used for this as well, but it requires a lot of due date juggling to make it work, or maybe not due dates but deferred dates, and really I don't think it's the right tool for this job. I use omnifocus for weekly tasks that have fixed due dates, like taking out the recycling on wednesday nights, and trash every other wednesday, and that's fine for that because really I just want a gentle reminder, but one that I will look at, so even if I snooze the reminder, I'll see that I still need to do it. I could probably use Productive.app for that, but I feel like Omnifocus works to track that, and then I also can easily track which weeks the trash goes out (because it's not every week in Portland)

Anyways, enough README.md, and maybe this should be MOTIVATION.md, but for now it will suffice.
